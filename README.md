# Age-v-Survivorship-Titanic-Dataset-

This is a very short project composed of my dive into doing tangible analysis using pandas and scipy in Juptyer Notebook. 
After taking several classes this past semester preparing me with the necessary background knowledge, I feel confident 
in moving forward and doing more of these projects to prepare myself for a work environment.

I uploaded both the notebook itself and an html version for easy viewing. I begin with looking at and visualizing
some of the features in the dataset, and I move on to conduct a simple two-sample t-test between the survivor group and the
deceased group, testing for a difference in mean age.
